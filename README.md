So to begin with I wanted to keep the design clean and appealing to the eyes. 
This is why I chose the colours blue, white and grey/black. These colours did not 
clash with each other and complimented each other well.
Starting with the title bar, the font I went for was a bit of a 90s vibe, something that puts
you back in that time when you had to scour websites for music. The font I used for the navigation bar was meant to
be normal and easy to read and i added background colours where I saw fit. For the homepage I wanted
to keep it simple but still have something going on in the screen. I added the cover art
of some of my favourite artists popular album or singles cover art. I looped all the images in 
a horizontal slide in affect that goes from out of screen left to out of screen right and then 
loops back around. For the featured artist section, I made an accordion ribbon across the top that gently floats onto
the page. Each section is a category of type of artist and has some of my favourite artist names that fit those categories.
Lastly the spotlight page is meant to showcase a new artist that we are listening to now. Hope you enjoy the website!!!
